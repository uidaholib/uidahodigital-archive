 <blockquote>
  <p>The library at the University of Idaho is magnificent in the amount of knowledge stored on its shelves. It affords ample opportunity for the student body to steep itself in literary calm. In science and philosophy, together with household arts, one can spend hours in revelry. In addition, there are books and magazines of a lighter character for those of a trivial nature. Those include&nbsp;“Life” and similar publications which are chiefly to divert one’s mind after the ordeal of studies.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Books and bookworms are the essential figure-heads in the library. Certain couples who make the library their habitat, are fast becoming fixtures like the books, tables, and librarians. The process is tedious and usually the couple graduates before arriving at the dignity of figurehead-dom.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Aside from this, the library is a meeting place for the student body. One might say that it is the melting pot for the University. Here is a blending of knowledge with that gentle art called&nbsp;“mixing”. The mixing is of a silent character. Silence means consent. Dates are made in this fashion.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The faculty is not blind to the advantages the library affords, and several may be found there at any time during the day. Often they become so absorbed in their studies that the five-minute limit is overstayed.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The library offers unparalleled opportunity for the study of human nature. One has a fascinating and diverting avocation in attempting to discern the reasons for the presence of the studious ones. Among the girls, some come to display a new dress, a new sweater, or a novel manner of arranging the hair. Some come to knit, others to read the popular magazines and to discuss the affairs and&nbsp;“cases” of themselves and others, while a minority come for serious work.</p>
  <p>With the men the same condition obtains. Instead of a new dress, as in the case of the co-eds, it may be a&nbsp;“keen” tie, or a pair of socks. They copy each others’ math problems, and spend the remainder of the time reading the society and sporting news in the&nbsp;“Argonaut”. With the men, too, as in the case of the co-eds, there are some who come for a serious purpose.</p>
  <p>The chief purposed of coming to the library is, however, a dual one, and is shared by both co-eds and men. We are now speaking of dates. We have already described how the dates are made, but the prevalence of this practice is greater than is commonly supposed, even by the Dean of Women. Words are rarely resorted to, for as soon as one speaks above a whisper, one feels the discomfort of having a chaperon present. One is confronted by the reproving eyes of the librarian, who reminds one of a mother-in-law. However, a smile, well-directed, will eliminate this difficulty. Thus hours may be spent in silence - a silence that is camouflage.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Over all this, the librarian presides. She is omiscient - omnipresent. She can make or break a romance. She is the official Recorder and Judge of dates. As we have the comptroller of currency in a clearing house, so we have the librarian as the comptroller of dates in the library.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>From this it may be seen that the library plays an important role in student life. It has a broadening influence, mentally and socially; and though sometimes, under the crush of assigned reading we mistakenly inveigh against it, we will always look back upon it as a bright spot in our college days.&nbsp;</p>
