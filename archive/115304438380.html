 <p>From the top:</p>
 <p><b>Helen Hartley Taylor</b> - Because her record as an undergraduate is marked by a series of accomplishments paralleled by few women on the campus, including president of the Associated Women Students and president of the Pan-Hellenic; and her endeavors in women’s organizations have been truly influential in and vital to their existence.</p>
 <p><b>Norma Geddes</b> - Because she has endeared herself to her fellow students with a personality in large measure molded from contact and constant participation in every problem of interest to the women student at Idaho; and is thereby deserving of all recognition of merit that may be bestowed upon her.</p>
 <p><b>Goldie May Smith</b> - Because her interests are perhaps more varied than any woman entered in the University, and include class activity as junior class treasurer, activity in woman’s circles as a participant in women’s sports, activity in the realm of music through her membership in musical societies, and general activity in campus affairs.</p>
 <p><b>Ethel Stanford Lafferty</b> - Because not only have her achievements included class leadership and activity in campus affairs as a result of her position as senior woman on the Executive Board, but also have included an interest in drama to such an extent that her name has been outstanding in college dramatics throughout her academic career.</p>
 <p><b>Estelle Marguerite Pickrell</b> - Because throughout her college life she has displayed a positive leadership in every activity she has been interested in, leadership in her class being especially noteworthy; and in so doing has acquired the distinction of being one of the foremost, if not the foremost, woman in her class.</p>
